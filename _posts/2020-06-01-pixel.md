#### This pixel art series was a challenge I set for myself in order to gain proficiency in the medium. Before starting this project, I no experience with pixel art, and almost none with art in general. Despite this, I decided that I would post something every day for 100 days, which motivated me to continuously learn and improve in the medium, even when I lacked confidence in my skills.

### Inspiration

#### I was inspired to start this project by the work and tutorials from various talented pixel artists, especially <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCC26K7LTSrJK0BPAUyyvtQg" target="_blank">Brandon James Greer</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC08QfQDLAd9D7aYPFgBUIng" target="_blank">Adam C Younis</a>, and <a href="https://www.slynyrd.com/" target="_blank">Slynyrd</a>. However, my greatest motivation to create something every day came from this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6NsEDwHHiE&t=503s" target="_blank">YouTube video</a>, whose main thesis is to do the same small thing every single day in order to truly improve at a skill.

### Tools

#### All of the pixel art itself was created using the program <a href="https://www.aseprite.org/" target="_blank">Aseprite</a>. While excellent for static art, this program also allowed me to easily create frames for animations. In order to compile these frames to video, I used open-source compositing software <a href="https://natrongithub.github.io/" target="_blank">Natron</a>.
